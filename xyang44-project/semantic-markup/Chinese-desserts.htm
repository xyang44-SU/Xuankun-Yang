							<h2>Chinese Steamed Sponge Cake</h2>
							<p>What makes this Chinese steamed sponge cake different from a typical sponge cake is that it is steamed, 
								making it extremely moist. Egg whites are beaten until frothy and then the yolks, sugar, and flour are added; 
								a bit of almond extract gives the cake a nice flavor. Once the batter is poured into the pan, 
								it is set in a wok filled with simmering water and covered until cooked.</p>
